            <h2>About J&K</h2>
            Jammu and Kashmir[b] is a region administered by India as a union territory[1] and consists of the southern
            portion of the larger Kashmir region, which has been the subject of a dispute between India and Pakistan
            since 1947 and between India and China since 1959.[3] The Line of Control separates Jammu and Kashmir from
            the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan in the west and north. It lies
            to the north of the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and to the west of Ladakh which is
            administered by India as a union territory.[2]

            Provisions for the formation of the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir were contained within the Jammu and
            Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, which was passed by both houses of the Parliament of India in August 2019.
            The act re-constituted the former state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories, one being Jammu and
            Kashmir and the other being Ladakh, with effect from 31 October 2019.[18]

            Terminology
            Jammu and Kashmir is named after the two regions it encompasses â€“ the Jammu region and the Kashmir Valley.
            As per Government of India, Kashmir region encompasses the region under Indian control and the territory
            under Pakistan control known as "Pakistan-occupied Kashmir" (POK).[19][20] While Pakistan considers the
            Indian controlled territory as a part of "Indian-occupied Kashmir" (IOK) or "Indian-held Kashmir"
            (IHK),[21][22] neutral sources use "Indian-administered Kashmir"/"Pakistan-administered Kashmir" and
            "Indian-controlled Kashmir"/"Pakistan-controlled Kashmir" to demarcate the areas.

            autonomy.[24] Indian citizens from other states were not allowed to purchase land or property in Jammu and
            Kashmir under Article 35A of the Constitution of India.
